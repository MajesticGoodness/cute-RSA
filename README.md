# About

This is a simple program which implements a working demo of RSA encryption algorithm. It selects a random integer from 0 to 1000, then produces a public-private keypair, outputs it to the console, then demonstrates encryption and decryption. Enjoy! ❤️

Note: This purely for demonstration/learning purposes. It does not provide good security since the random number generator used is not cryptographically secure.
