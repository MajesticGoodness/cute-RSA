# About

This is a simple program which implements a working demo of RSA encryption algorithm. It produces a public-private key pair, outputs it to the console, then generates a random integer between 0 and 1000 to demonstrate encryption and decryption on. Enjoy! ❤️

Note: This purely for demonstration/learning purposes. It does not provide good security since the random number generator used is not cryptographically secure.
